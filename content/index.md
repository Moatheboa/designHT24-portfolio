Hi! My name is Moa. 
Apart from doing half-time studies I am working as a circus artist, specialized in aerial acrobatics.
I've been studying to a various degree within programming for one and a half years.
I find it super interesting with the psychological part of design -how we respond to different colors, layouts and themes. And how we can use those components to create an atmosphere, even telling a story.
