#Portfolio DesignHT24
This is a webpage created through an excercise of the course Technical webdesign and usabilty (Teknisk webbdesign och anv√§ndbarhet) 7.5 credits, at BTH, autumn 2024.
This project uses Pico, a flat-file CMS that works without a database. Content is written in Markdown, and layout is handled with Twig templates.
